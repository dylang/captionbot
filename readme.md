* Requires Node 4 or newer.
* Powered by [CaptionBot](https://www.captionbot.ai/), a free service provided by Microsoft.
* If you like this, you can read more at https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services.
* This node module was not created by Microsoft.
* I would consider this module "for testing only" - I do not recommend using in a production system.
* Microsoft: I made this because I am a fan of the technology. If there are any problems, or you want to use this package name, I'm happy to discuss.
